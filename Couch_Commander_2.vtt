00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.202
<a> The Obama's are staying in D.C. for two 

00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:04.270
years after the President leaves office.</a>

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.805
Chuck Todd: He's about to go from Commander in Chief

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.408
to Couch Commander.

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:10.510
you, Chuck Todd.!

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.047
What am I going to do in D.C. for two years?

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.416
(music)

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:17.217
The Vice President: Get around to London,

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.852
Mr. President.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.487
The President: I can't go every day, can I?

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.287
The Vice President: Which do you like better?

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.156
These?

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.258
Or These?

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:26.493
The President: Joe, they're the same.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.862
The Vice President: They capture different moods.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.130
The President: Joe, I need some focus here.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.730
The Vice President: Coming in here during aviator time,

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:32.532
thinks everything --

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:33.465
The President: I'm sorry, what's that?

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.601
The Vice President: I said, Mr. President,

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.902
you got to be practical.

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:37.303
And look, you can drive again,

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.071
you're going to need a license.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.307
You love sports, why don't you volunteer to work one of

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.275
the teams around here?

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:43.176
(music)

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:44.411
The President: Is this the Washington Wizards?

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.613
I understand you're looking for some coaching help.

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:49.214
Let's just say I coached my daughter's team a few times.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.350
Hello?

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.252
Hello?

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:58.558
(music)

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.527
Female Speaker: 44.

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:01.728
The President: Finally.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.229
So, I'm going to be in D.C. for awhile,

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.164
and I thought I'd take up driving again.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.032
Female Speaker: What's the name?

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:08.334
The President: Barack Hussein Obama.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.804
Female Speaker: Yikes.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.772
Well, since you don't have a driver's license,

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:14.674
you're going to need a birth certificate.

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:15.708
The President: Really?

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:19.879
Female Speaker: Really.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:20.747
The President: It's real.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.182
Female Speaker: Is it?

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:23.383
The President: It's real.

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.951
Female Speaker: But is it?

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.351
(music)

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:26.920
The President: Oh.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.588
Michelle left her phone.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:29.756
Let's see here.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.057
Huh.

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.559
She's got Snapchat.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.527
Obamacare is great!

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.196

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:40.967
Wolf Blitzer: Michelle Obama in hot water,

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:44.304
after posting this video earlier today.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.239
The President: Obamacare is great!

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:47.974
And it's really working!

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:55.248
Sign up now!

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:56.349
No?

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:57.217
Mrs. Obama: No.

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:58.151
The President: Did it get a lot of views, at least?

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:59.252
Mrs. Obama: Honey, enough.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:01:59.752
Enough.

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:01.187
Why don't you just talk to somebody who has been

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.755
through this.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:07.259
I got to go to SoulCycle.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.662
The President: She's right.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:12.065
I know who I need to talk to.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.100
Hey.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.535
It's Barack.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:16.835
Listen, could we get together.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:19.439
(music)

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.975
Now that is a great movie.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:22.642
John Boehner: Yeah.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:26.546
It gets me every time.

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:28.748
Tom Hanks: So long, partner.

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:31.851
(music)

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.853
The President: So, you got any advice for me?

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:35.488
John Boehner: So now you want my advice?

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:38.391
First, stop sending me all these LinkedIn requests.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.927
And second, here's the beauty of this whole thing.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.596
You've got all the time in the world to figure this out.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.598
You can just be you for awhile.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.333
If you know how to do that again.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.234
The President: So I can just be me.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.504
(music)

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.305
And I can wear my mom jeans in peace.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.507
I hate these tight jeans.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:55.375
John Boehner: That's good.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:59.078
That's good.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.981
Yesterday, I had a beer at 11:30 in the morning.

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:05.852
And you know, McDonalds now serves breakfast all day long.

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:06.819
The President: And Michelle's going to be at

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.655
spin class, so she'll never know.

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:09.389
John Boehner: Right.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.256
Let it go.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:12.492
And it won't be long, you'll be able to walk right out of

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:15.295
the Oval Office singing Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:16.262
Zip-a-Dee-Day.

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:17.830
(laughter)

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.868
And you've got plenty of time to work on your tan.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:22.969
And you know what?

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:31.077
I finally got the grand bargain on a sweet Chevy Tahoe.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.846
Look here.

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:34.881
Look here.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:39.919
You want one?

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:40.520
Wolf Blitzer: Breaking news.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.891
Former President Barack Obama on his 347th round of

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:48.695
golf for the year, and it's totally great.

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:51.130
And Gloria, not a problem for anybody.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.566
Gloria Borger: I can't think of a reason to care, Wolf.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.935
And believe me, I've tried.

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:59.706
(music)
